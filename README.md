# Repliq Mart

This project is a practice project, a task assigned by Repliq for the **Junior React Developer** position.

In this project, I have used **NextJS v13**, **TailwindCSS v3.3.2**, **Typescript**, and **MUI** to design the admin panel. I have also used **Context** as state management for practice, instead of Redux or Redux Toolkit. Authentication is being handled from the backend. The backend was implemented by me almost a year ago, and you can find it [here](https://github.com/rakify/ecommerce-site-mern-mui). Previously, I have worked on a project with Redux Toolkit, a multi-vendor full-stack ecommerce project, and you can find it [here](https://github.com/rakify/ecommerce-frontend)."
